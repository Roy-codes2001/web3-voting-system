# web3-voting-system
A Decentralized Voting System made with Solidity on the Ethereum Blockchain

**Scenario:** Voting system to decide on a manifesto/policy.

### Why it needs to be decentralized?
- Since, the blockchain stores everything as a transaction, it provides a receipt of every vote (in a form of a transaction ID). Which can then be used to ensure that the vote has been counted securely. 
- A decentralized voting system would ensure that no vote gets forged or breached. Essentially making the votes are immutabale, secure, and transparent.
